You got this response while testing an API endpoint

{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}

This message is actually very helpful. It indicates that:
The endpoint exists (i.e., it's not a 404).

It expects authentication (likely via a token in headers or a query parameter).

You're probably not blocked or rate-limited yet.

Here’s how you can test this API for vulnerabilities step by step:
1. Check the HTTP Method
Try different methods:
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/
curl -X PUT https://api.example.com/
curl -X DELETE https://api.example.com/
Look at status codes and error messages. A 405 (Method Not Allowed) or a different response could give clues.

2. Add a Random Token
Check how the server reacts to malformed or dummy tokens:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer fake123" https://api.example.com/
If you get a different error like "Invalid Token" or "Unauthorized", that confirms it uses Bearer authentication (JWT or similar).

3. Fuzz Common Paths
Try appending common API routes:

https://api.dextf.com/dcd/users
https://api.dextf.com/dcd/admin
https://api.dextf.com/dcd/config
https://api.dextf.com/dcd/.env
https://api.dextf.com/dcd/debug

Use tools like:
#ffuf -u api.example.com/dd/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/api/api-endpoints.txt
#ffuf -u api.example.com/dd/FUZZ -w /home/cyborg/Downloads/everything.txt -mc 200 

4. Headers to Try

-H "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1"
-H "X-Original-URL: /admin"
-H "X-Api-Key: test"
Sometimes APIs allow access when certain headers are manipulated — test for this.

5. Look for GraphQL
Check if it's a GraphQL API:
curl -X POST https://api.dextf.com/dcd/ -d '{"query":"{__schema{types{name}}}"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
If it responds differently, it may be a GraphQL endpoint in disguise.

6. JWT Weaknesses
If you find a JWT token from recon (maybe in a mobile app), try:
Decoding it (use jwt.io)
Cheking for alg: none bypass
Brute-forcing with common secrets

7. CORS Misconfiguration
curl -I -H "Origin: https://evil.com" https://api.example.com/dcd/
Check if the API replies with:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
or mirrors back the evil domain. That could allow cross-site abuse.

8. Look for OpenAPI/Swagger Docs
Try:
https://api.dextf.com/swagger
https://api.dextf.com/swagger.json
https://api.dextf.com/docs
https://api.dextf.com/openapi.json
